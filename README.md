```

```sh
yarn add @focusreactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input
```

```sh
pnpm add @focusreactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input
```

## Usage

1. Add it as a plugin in `sanity.config.ts` (or .js):

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'sanity'
import { inlineSvgInput } from '@focusreactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  plugins: [inlineSvgInput()],
})
```

2. Use the `inlineSvg` type in your schema types:

```ts
// [...]
{
  fields: [
    // [...]
    {
      name: 'svgIcon',
      title: 'SVG Icon',
      type: 'inlineSvg',
    },
  ]
}
```

## Preview

### List view

To preview the SVG in the list view, you can use the `InlineSvgPreviewItem` component:

```tsx
const IconsListItem = defineType({
  type: 'object',
  name: 'iconsListItem',
  fields: [
    {
      type: 'string',
      name: 'title',
    },
    {
      type: 'string',
      name: 'text',
    },
    {
      type: 'inlineSvg',
      name: 'icon',
    },
  ],
  preview: {
    select: {
      title: 'title',
      subtitle: 'text',
      icon: 'icon',
    },
  },
  components: {
    preview: (props: PreviewProps<PreviewLayoutKey>) => {
      return <InlineSvgPreviewItem {...props} />
    },
  },
})

const IconsList = defineType({
  name: 'iconsList',
  type: 'array',
  of: [{ type: 'iconsListItem' }],
})
```

### Preview component

If you want to use the SVG in your preview component, you can use the `InlineSvgPreviewComponent`:

```tsx
import { InlineSvgPreviewComponent } from '@focusreactive/sanity-plugin-inline-svg-input'

export const PreviewComponent = ({ value }) => {
  return (
    //...
    <InlineSvgPreviewComponent value={value} />
    //...
  )
}
```
